      <p>
        VirMar isnâ€™t just a virtual market â€” itâ€™s a digital microcosm where commerce meets community.
        Our mission? Empower everyday entrepreneurs, enable secure transactions, and recreate the pulse
        of real-world buying and selling in a borderless space.
      </p>
      <p>
        With features like geolocation-based delivery alerts, QR-verified drop-offs, and buyer-to-buyer
        interaction â€” VirMar is built to feel real. As real as your neighborhood Sunday market, but way
        more scalable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stay tuned as we break down how weâ€™re building escrow logic, dynamic pricing, and interactive
        social features. This is just the beginning ðŸš€
